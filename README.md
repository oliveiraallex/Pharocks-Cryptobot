# Pharocks Cryptobot

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oliveiraallex/Pharocks-Cryptobot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/oliveiraallex/Pharocks-Cryptobot)


Pharocks Cryptobot is a robot app built in Pharo, for buying and selling cryptocurrency pairs, based on a loss / gain percentage strategy.

Different cryptocurrency pairs can be traded, such as Bitcoin / Tether (BTCUSDT), Ethereum / Bitcoin (ETHBTC) or Litecoin / Binancecoin (LTCBNB) for example.

To buy and sell, you need an account in an cryptocurrency exchange, for Pharocks to create buy and sell orders according to the configured strategy.

For now, it is possible to use only with Binance's cryptocurrency exchange, so an account there is mandatory. [Create your Binance account now!](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=35954516)
